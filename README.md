# List-based-FIFO-Queue

This project showcases the implementation of a List-based First-In-First-Out (FIFO) Queue data structure using a linked list in C++. The queue is built upon the concepts of a doubly linked list and features additional functionalities specific to managing a queue efficiently.

## Features

- PUSH N: Enqueue an element with value N to the end of the queue.
- POP: Dequeue the first element from the front of the queue.
- PRINT_QUEUE: Print the elements of the queue from the front to the last element added.
- COUNT: Get the number of elements in the queue (limited by the predefined SIZE).
- GARBAGE_SOFT: Set the values of elements not in the queue to 0.
- GARBAGE_HARD: Remove all elements from the list that do not belong to the queue.

## Installation

No special installation is required. Simply clone the repository and compile the code using a C++ compiler.
